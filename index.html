    <h2>What is Bullying?</h2>
    <p>
      Bullying usually includes three key elements: <strong>intent</strong>, <strong>repetition</strong>, and <strong>power</strong>. 
      A bully intends to cause harm—either physical or emotional—and does so repeatedly. 
      Boys often experience more physical bullying, while girls may face psychological forms.
